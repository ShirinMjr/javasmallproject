You are designing a software application that incorporates various geometric shapes as a core element of the application.  As you gather requirements for the first version, you learn that initially you need to support circle, square and rectangle.  You also learn that future implementations may include additional geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon), so you need the flexibility to support other types of shapes in the future, as well as other types of calculations for the shapes (e.g. perimeter).  Use the object-oriented language with which you are most comfortable.

The area of a geometric shape is calculated based on formulas that depend on the type of shape.  For example, the area of a circle depends on its radius; the area of a square or rectangle depends on the lengths of its sides. In the initial implementation consumers of your classes must be able to create circles, squares and rectangles of any size and to get the area of each.

a. Write the code to solve this.  Code should be detailed enough to include necessary attributes and methods (including constructors).  Implement what you would consider the best object-oriented approach to the problem.

b. Write a code snippet to create a collection to store multiple objects from question (2a).

c. Write a code snippet to create several objects including the various types and store them in the collection from question (2b).

d. Sort the collection in order of size such that the first shape has the largest area.
